# Introduction

## Project Title

**VR Movement Therapy**  
This repository includes the prototype of *Game On: Leveraging Procedural Content Generation to enhance VR Game Engagement for children with Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy*, referred to as *CachingGame*.

---

## Purpose

This project explores Virtual Reality (VR) applications for children with Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy (HCP) on a standalone head-mounted display, specifically the **HTC VIVE XR Elite VR**. The primary goal is to create immersive environments that supports and motivates those children to increase physical activities.

The project leverages Unity and the Wave Unity SDK to build VR applications that can run natively on VIVE Standalone hardware without external dependencies.

## System Overview

Each VR game in this repository follows a modular architecture with support for real-time interaction via controllers.

## CachingGame

This application is a game, created to entice children with HCP to be more physically active in their leisure time. 
The CachingGame's scene is located under `CachingGameRepo/Assets/Scenes/Thesis.unity`

Scripts developed for this work are located in `CachingGameRepo/Assets/Sripts/CachingGame` and illustrated in the following UML diagram:
